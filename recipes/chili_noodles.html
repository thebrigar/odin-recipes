        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Chili crisp chili noodles</strong> are a popular dish that features the prominent Chinese condiment, chili crisp. They are known for their spicy, tangy, savory flavor, and satisfying crunchy texture derived from the chili crisp, according to Fly By Jing.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages dry ramen noodles, flavor packets discarded</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chil crisp</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped roasted peanuts</li>
            <li>thinly sliced green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil. Add ramen, and cook until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain noodles; reserve some cooking water to thin the sauce later if needed.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, whisk soy sauce, chili crisp, peanut butter, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a small bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Add cooked noodles to a bowl, pour in sauce, and toss until well coated and combined. If sauce is too thick, stir in some reserved pasta water.</ol>
        <ol>Garnish with peanuts and sliced green onions and serve with extra chili crisp on the side.</ol>
